# CSPB 3287  LAB-6
# Lab: Join Costs
In this problem set, you're doing to compute the cost of JOIN operations for different relations. We're only looking at the cost of joins, although the text covers the cost of other operations (intersection, etc) . Each section of the reading has a "summary of cost" that can be used as a reference to find the specific join algorithm.

You'll also be implementing a hash join in Python -- most of the heavy lifting has been done for you in the file nfl.py that shows the sensitivity of hash joins to the specific hash function.

You should use the Python Notebook to provide your solutions. The existing code is structured such that you can provide a computation for a specific value and that the value is then printed out. This is done to allow you to use code to compute your value in terms of the variables for a given problem (e.g. P_R and the like).
