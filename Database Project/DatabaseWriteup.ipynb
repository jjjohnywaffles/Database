    "# Introduction\n",
    "My database project focuses on managing a hospital's databaseâ€™s information. The primary use cases of this database revolves around streamlining patient information, treatment records, and the schedules of doctors within a hospital setting. This project incorporates multiple tables, establishes relationships through foreign keys, and showcases essential elements such as SQL statements for table creation, data insertion, updates, and queries. The motivation behind my Hospital Management System Database Project stems from the desire to create an efficient and organized system to manage various aspects of hospital operations. "

    "# Table Creation\n",
    "The tables created within this database include Patients, Doctors, Treatments, Billing and Appointments. While a real hospital most likely has significantly more tables and relationships, the tables I have included show a generalization of what data can be stored and returned. From our table creation, we can see how treatments, billing and appointments utilize foreign keys to ensure referential integrity and an example of this includes the data within the Billing table. The foreign key references within the table ensure that billing information corresponds to valid patients and treatments. \n",

    "In order to actually move data into our database, python scripts were utilized to import .csv files into their respective tables. For this section, since I had trouble finding relevant, already available datasets online, the data utilized within the database is hand generated using Excel. This is the reason why the names of patients and doctors are numerical values since I had trouble randomly generating a vast quantity of names. While the scripts are unique for each individual table, they all follow the same general outline. \n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This hospital database project has been a journey into the essentials of effective database management. I aimed to cover key aspects from creating table relationships and inserting data to crafting smart queries, optimizing with indexes, and implementing triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table Design and Data Entry:\n",
    "The heart of any good database is how its tables are created. In this project, tables including Patients, Doctors, Treatments, Billing, and Appointments were created to showcase the relationships between various entities within a database. Each table captures a specific part of how a hospital operates. While my process to input data can definitely see improvement, the database accurately returned data along with depicting the relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Smart Queries:\n",
    "Being able to ask the database questions is a big part of using it well. The queries I've shown here are only a few of the vast capabilities various queries can accomplish. From basic info to complex searches and grouping, these queries can cover a plethora of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimized Indexes:\n",
    "To make searches faster, I used smart indexing. Making indexes on specific columns, like idx_AppointmentDate and idx_Anesthesiology_DoctorID, helps the database find and sort information quickly. This is crucial for larger databases or when you need quick responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triggers:\n",
    "Triggers add another layer to keep data in check. The triggers I've used, like stopping duplicate treatments on the same day and limiting doctor appointments per day, show how the database can actively follow rules and keep data consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, my main goal was to grasp how databases work and how they organize information. It's clear that a well-designed database is key to getting clean, useful data. Furthermore, this project has deepened my understanding of database management. As I wrap it up, I'm taking away a set of skills and a stronger sense of how crucial databases are in handling and making sense of information in different fields."
